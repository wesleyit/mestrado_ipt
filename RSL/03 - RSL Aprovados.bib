	abstract = {Quantum computing is emerging as a significant threat to information protected by widely used cryptographic systems. Cryptographic methods, once deemed secure for decades, are now at risk of being compromised, posing a massive threat to the security of sensitive data and communications across enterprises worldwide. As a result, there is an urgent need to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems. This is no simple task. Migrating to a quantum-safe state is a complex process, and many organisations lack the in-house expertise to navigate this transition without guidance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework designed to assist enterprises with this migration. Our framework outlines essential steps involved in the cryptographic migration process, and leverages existing organisational inventories. The framework facilitates the efficient identification of cryptographic assets and can be integrated with other enterprise frameworks smoothly. To underscore its practicality and effectiveness, we have incorporated case studies that utilise graph-theoretic techniques to pinpoint and assess cryptographic dependencies. This is useful in prioritising crypto-systems for replacement.},

	abstract = {Crypto agility refers to the ability of an entity to replace existing crypto primitives, algorithms, or protocols with a new alternative quickly, inexpensively, with no or acceptable risk exposure. These changes may be driven by regulatory action, advances in computing, or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Yet everyday operational needs may put crypto agility considerations on the back burner when deploying technology, designing processes, or developing products/services. Consequently, changes are often performed in an ad hoc manner. Transition from one crypto solution to another can then take a long time and expose organizations to unnecessary security risk. This paper presents a framework to analyze and evaluate the risk that results from the lack of crypto agility. The proposed framework can be used by organizations to determine an appropriate mitigation strategy commensurate with their risk tolerance. We demonstrate the application of this framework with a case study of quantum computing and related threats to cryptography in the context of {TLS} for Internet of Things.},
