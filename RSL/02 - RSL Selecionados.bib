	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems ({CPS}) are considered a crucial part for providing connectivity in industrial environments. However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that {CPS} are secured against current and — due to their long life span — also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture ({OPC} {UA}). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms ({KEMs}), namely {NewHope}, {NTRU}, {CRYSTALS}-Kyber, and Saber. We implement our resulting quantum-resistant modifications of {OPC} {UA} on two different {ARM} based platforms and present detailed performance footprints. Finally, we show the feasibility of employing hybrid quantum-resistant key exchange within {OPC} {UA} preserving industrial communication against future threats.},

	abstract = {Although quantum computing is still in its nascent age, its evolution threatens the most popular public-key encryption systems. Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman ({RSA}), elliptic curve cryptography ({ECC}) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security ({TLS}), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to {IoT} devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like {IoT} applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term {IoT} device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat. This article provides a survey on what can be called post-quantum {IoT} systems ({IoT} systems protected from the currently known quantum computing attacks): the main post-quantum cryptosystems and initiatives are reviewed, the most relevant {IoT} architectures and challenges are analyzed, and the expected future trends are indicated. Thus, this article is aimed at providing a wide view of post-quantum {IoT} security and give useful guidelines to the future post-quantum {IoT} developers.},

Quantum computers threaten public key cryptography algorithms like {RSA} (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) and Diffie-Hellman ({DH}) key exchange schemes, which are widely in use today.

However, solutions like Quantum Key Distribution require heavy infrastructure. So, it is not feasible for the Internet of Things with fewer resources in computing power and form factor.

	abstract = {An important enabler of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) is the Narrow-Band Internet of Things ({NB}-{IoT}) technology, which is a 3GPP standards compliant connectivity solution. Quantum computing, another emerging technological paradigm, promises novel compute opportunities but is also able to compromise cybersecurity ciphers. Therefore, improved methods to mitigate such security threats are needed. In this research, we propose a location-aware cryptographic system that guarantees post-quantum {IoT} security. The ultimate value of a location-driven cryptosystem is to use the geographic location as a player’s identity and credential. Position-driven cryptography using lattices is efficient and lightweight, and it can be used to protect sensitive and confidential data in many critical situations that rely heavily on exchanging confidential data. At the best of our knowledge, this research starts the study of unconditional-quantum-resistant-location-driven cryptography by using the Lattice problem for the {IoT} in a pre-and post-quantum world. Unlike existing schemes, the proposed cryptosystem is the first secure and unrestricted position-based protocol that guards against any number of collusion attackers and against quantum attacks. It has a guaranteed authentication process, solves the problems of distributing public keys by removing a public key infrastructure ({PKI}), offers secure {NB}-{IoT} without {SIM} cards, and resists location spoofing attacks. Furthermore, it can be generalized to any network – not just {NB}-{IoT}.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles ({AV}) have as one of their characteristics the constant exchange of data with other vehicles, radio base stations, pedestrians and infrastructure. Despite this data exchange using the most modern security techniques, vehicles have been the target of constant cyber-attacks. Emerging technologies such as quantum computing have been tested to minimize these attacks. Particularly, this work investigates the possibility of using post-quantum computing techniques in {IoT} (Internet of Things) devices, more specifically in {AVs}. Considering the functionalities of a vehicle nowadays, it is possible to say that a vehicle is composed of a set of {IoT} devices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a post-quantum secure method to be used in {IoT} devices for data exchange between {AVs} and a 5G base station. In this method, the post-quantum algorithm {NTRU} is implemented in an edge computing {IoT} architecture between the source of the {CVs} data and the edge layer, which is a vulnerable spot for quantum-attacks. We simulated the implementation of the algorithm in a case study and monitored how the algorithm performed. The proposed methodology was capable of providing secure communication between {IoT} and edge layer. However, the message length and parameters from the algorithm can slow down the communication.},

	abstract = {As the Internet of Things ({IoT}) expands explosively existing network connections, the transmission and processing of private data is facing more serious threats of leakage and theft. Classical public key encryption schemes are difficult to guarantee strong security protection, because the mathematically hard problems they rely on are no longer difficult to solve under the rapid development of quantum computing. Therefore, a more high-performance and quantum-resistant encryption scheme Ring-{ExpLWE} is proposed, in which the error vector is sampled in the exponential distribution instead of the binary distribution in the previous Ring-{BinLWE}. We evaluate the Ring-{ExpLWE}’s security level by analyzing the runtime under quantum hybrid attack and comparing the standard deviation of the noise polynomial coefficients. Compared with Ring-{BinLWE}, the proposed Ring-{ExpLWE} requires larger runtime for quantum hybrid attack and has a more discrete noise distribution. Therefore, Ring-{ExpLWE} can provide a higher security level under the same parameter set. Moreover, the high-performance software and hardware implementations for the Ring-{ExpLWE} scheme are proposed, respectively. Based on the Cortex-M3 microprocessor platform, encryption, and decryption only require 35.6 and 17.8 ms in our software implementation, respectively. Compared with the previous Ring-{BinLWE} schemes, while significantly improving the security level, the Area {\textbackslash}times Time ({AT}) of our high-performance and lightweight hardware implementations is reduced by 49.2\% and 49.5\%, respectively, when the {FPGA} platform is Spartan 6.},

Therefore, post-quantum n-to-n communication encryption is a crucial field of research. Here, the development of new schemes and the analysis, and comparison of existing schemes is necessary. However, current work only investigates the performance of post-quantum schemes only for 1-to-1 communication. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze existing post-quantum schemes concerning n-to-n communication and compare them with pre-quantum schemes. Our results show that the pre-quantum schemes perform better regarding computation times than the post-quantum schemes, but the differences are sometimes only marginal. However, these marginal differences in computation times lead to the lower energy efficiency of the post-quantum schemes. In terms of features, there is no difference between both scheme classes. We show that the post-quantum schemes require unicast, whereas some pre-quantum schemes also support broadcast. Deciding whether to use pre- or post-quantum schemes for n-to-n encryption in {IoT} use cases depends on (i) whether energy efficiency is essential – e.g., in case of limited power supply – and (ii) whether unicast or broadcast is available.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) is gaining ground as a pervasive presence around us by enabling miniaturized “things” with computation and communication capabilities to collect, process, analyze, and interpret information. Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the data generated by these things, for critical decision-making processes, data debugging, risk assessment, forensic analysis, and performance tuning. Currently, secure and reliable data communication in {IoT} is based on public-key cryptosystems such as the elliptic curve cryptosystem ({ECC}). Nevertheless, the reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this article, we investigate applications of one of the postquantum signatures called hash-based signature ({HBS}) schemes for the security of {IoT} devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of {HBS} schemes with an emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of {HBS} schemes and their significance for {IoT} security in the quantum era. We also investigate the optimal selection of {HBS} in the {IoT} networks with respect to their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives. In addition to ongoing standardization efforts, we also highlight current and future research and deployment challenges along with possible solutions. Finally, we outline the essential measures and recommendations that must be adopted by the {IoT} ecosystem while preparing for the quantum world.},

The Gaussian sampler is a crucial part in lattice-based post-quantum cryptosystems, thus being the most vulnerable module to side-channel attack as well. However, research on the countermeasures for the Gaussian sampler against power side-channel attacks is almost blank. In this article, a flexible and generic cumulative distribution table ({CDT})-based Gaussian sampler using the hardware-software approach is proposed. The proposed {CDT} sampler has an {AHB} interface and can be reconfigured to support various parameter sets, while utilizing just 77 Slices on a Xilinx Spartan-6 {FPGA} with constant response time. Additionally, the first simple power analysis ({SPA}) attack on the {CDT} sampler is presented. The presented attack mainly takes advantage of the chosen input and the {SPA} vulnerability associated with the binary search method, hence the attacker is able to recover every sampled value by comparing a few pairs of power consumption traces. To further protect against chosen input {SPA} attack, this article identifies the vulnerability associated with three main operations in every binary search state and construct an effective countermeasure based on randomization at the cost of only extra 58.4\% Slices. Compared to other related works, the merits of the proposed {CDT} sampler are the high hardware flexibility, side-channel security, and suitability for resource-constrained {IoT} nodes.},

	abstract = {Digital signatures provide scalable authentication with non-repudiation and therefore are vital tools for the Internet of Things ({IoT}). {IoT} applications harbor vast quantities of low-end devices that are expected to operate for long periods with a risk of compromise. Hence, {IoT} needs post-quantum cryptography ({PQC}) that respects the resource limitations of low-end devices while offering compromise resiliency (e.g., forward-security). However, as seen in {NIST} {PQC} efforts, quantum-safe signatures are extremely costly for low-end {IoT}. These costs become prohibitive when forward security is considered. We propose a highly lightweight post-quantum digital signature called {HArdware}-Supported Efficient Signature ({HASES}) that meets the stringent requirements of resource-limited signers (processor, memory, bandwidth) with forward security. {HASES} transforms a key-evolving one-time hash-based signature into a polynomially unbounded one by introducing a public key oracle via secure enclaves. The signer is non-interactive and only generates a few hashes per signature. Unlike existing hardware-supported alternatives, {HASES} does not require a secure-hardware on the signer, which is infeasible for low-end {IoT}. {HASES} also does not assume non-colluding servers that permit scalable verification. We proved that {HASES} is secure and implemented it on the commodity hardware and the 8-bit {AVR} {ATmega}2560 microcontroller. Our experiments confirm that {HASES} is 271{\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathbfand{\textbackslash} 34{\textbackslash}times faster than (forward-secure) {XMSS} and (plain) Dilithium. {HASES} is more than twice and magnitude more energy-efficient than (forward-secure) {ANT} and (plain) {BLISS}, respectively, on an 8-bit device. We open-source {HASES} for public testing and adaptation.},

	abstract = {Public-key cryptography ({PKC}) provides confidentiality, data integrity, and user authentication. Particularly, non-repudiation, authentication and integrity of transmitted messages are assured by public-key signature schemes. Since the presence of a large scale quantum computer would be a real threat to break currently used public-key cryptographic algorithms, all security protocols based on the public-key cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable to quantum-computer attacks. It needs to investigate possible alternatives, post-quantum cryptography ({PQC}), believed to be resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers. All the traditional {PKC} should be replaced with {PQC} for secure communications in post-quantum era. In this work, we evaluate the post-quantum signature schemes in terms of various metrics, performance, signature/key sizes, energy consumption, resistance to implementation attacks and adaptability to Internet protocols. We then investigate their suitability for {IoTs} based on these metrics.},

	abstract = {5th Generation(5G)-enabled Internet of Things ({IoT}) connects billions of devices for high -speed data transfer. The data collected fuel many automation applications such as smart cities, industrial automation 5.0, autonomous vehicles and healthcare sectors. However, the critical challenges concerning such an environment are Open Web Security and Mutual Authentication. The recent security protocols of {IoT} are based on hard mathematical cryptographic structures. Nevertheless, dependency on the security of classical cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by Quantum Computing. Recent Quantum attacks on {IoT} security have motivated us to survey Quantum-resistant solutions comprehensively. Therefore in this paper, we analysed how the technology shifts from classical cryptographic techniques towards quantum-enabled solutions to achieve end-to-end security. The main objective of this survey is to provide a systematic roadmap in the area of Quantum secured 5G-enabled {IoT} communication by covering current research on 5G-enabled {IoT} with its key enabling technologies, threats imposed on 5G-enabled {IoT} applications, state-of-the-art quantum-based solutions and initiatives. A detailed overview of the quantum computing preliminaries, Post Quantum Cryptography ({PQC}) schemes, Quantum Cryptography ({QC}), and Quantum Key Distribution ({QKD}) with their significant advantage in securing {IoT}-enabled communication over classical scenarios are also presented. Particularly, we emphasize Post-Quantum resistant techniques that must be used soon to secure 5G-enabled {IoT} communications. The comparative analysis of quantum-resistant schemes with classical cryptographic schemes in terms of key size, data size, time complexity and impact of quantum computers on these schemes are discussed. This paper identifies the technical challenges in Quantum-based schemes and provides future research directions to enable Post-Quantum resistant cryptography for secure communication in 5G-enabled {IoT}.},

	doi = {10.3390/s21051883},
	abstract = {Postquantum cryptography for elevating security against attacks by quantum computers in the Internet of Everything ({IoE}) is still in its infancy. Most postquantum based cryptosystems have longer keys and signature sizes and require more computations that span several orders of magnitude in energy consumption and computation time, hence the sizes of the keys and signature are considered as another aspect of security by green design. To address these issues, the security solutions should migrate to the advanced and potent methods for protection against quantum attacks and offer energy efficient and faster cryptocomputations. In this context, a novel security framework Lightweight Postquantum {ID}-based Signature ({LPQS}) for secure communication in the {IoE} environment is presented. The proposed {LPQS} framework incorporates a supersingular isogeny curve to present a digital signature with small key sizes which is quantum-resistant. To reduce the size of the keys, compressed curves are used and the validation of the signature depends on the commutative property of the curves. The unforgeability of {LPQS} under an adaptively chosen message attack is proved. Security analysis and the experimental validation of {LPQS} are performed under a realistic software simulation environment to assess its lightweight performance considering embedded nodes. It is evident that the size of keys and the signature of {LPQS} is smaller than that of existing signature-based postquantum security techniques for {IoE}. It is robust in the postquantum environment and efficient in terms of energy and computations.},

This threatens the security of any cryptographic system which often relies on the difficulty of factorisation. It also threatens methods based on discrete logarithms, such as with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method. For a cryptographic system to remain secure against a quantum adversary, we need to build methods based on a hard mathematical problem, which are not susceptible to Shor's algorithm and create Post Quantum Cryptography ({PQC}). While high-powered computing devices may be able to run these new methods, we need to investigate how well these methods run on limited powered devices. This paper outlines an evaluation framework for {PQC} within constrained devices, and contributes to the area by providing benchmarks of the front-running algorithms on a popular single-board low-power device. It also introduces a set of five notions which can be considered to determine the robustness of particular algorithms.},

Modern {SCADA} systems have evolved from standalone systems into sophisticated, complex, open systems connected to the Internet.

Traditional {SCADA} systems were less exposed to Internet threats as they operated on isolated networks.

Cryptographic methods, once deemed secure for decades, are now at risk of being compromised, posing a massive threat to the security of sensitive data and communications across enterprises worldwide. As a result, there is an urgent need to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems. This is no simple task. Migrating to a quantum-safe state is a complex process, and many organisations lack the in-house expertise to navigate this transition without guidance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework designed to assist enterprises with this migration. Our framework outlines essential steps involved in the cryptographic migration process, and leverages existing organisational inventories. The framework facilitates the efficient identification of cryptographic assets and can be integrated with other enterprise frameworks smoothly. To underscore its practicality and effectiveness, we have incorporated case studies that utilise graph-theoretic techniques to pinpoint and assess cryptographic dependencies. This is useful in prioritising crypto-systems for replacement.},

	abstract = {Crypto agility refers to the ability of an entity to replace existing crypto primitives, algorithms, or protocols with a new alternative quickly, inexpensively, with no or acceptable risk exposure. These changes may be driven by regulatory action, advances in computing, or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Yet everyday operational needs may put crypto agility considerations on the back burner when deploying technology, designing processes, or developing products/services. Consequently, changes are often performed in an ad hoc manner. Transition from one crypto solution to another can then take a long time and expose organizations to unnecessary security risk. This paper presents a framework to analyze and evaluate the risk that results from the lack of crypto agility. The proposed framework can be used by organizations to determine an appropriate mitigation strategy commensurate with their risk tolerance. We demonstrate the application of this framework with a case study of quantum computing and related threats to cryptography in the context of {TLS} for Internet of Things.},

	abstract = {A digital signature is an essential cryptographic tool to offer authentication with public verifiability, non-repudiation, and scalability. However, digital signatures often rely on expensive operations that can be highly costly for low-end devices, typically seen in the Internet of Things and Systems ({IoTs}). These efficiency concerns especially deepen when post-quantum secure digital signatures are considered. Hence, it is of vital importance to devise post-quantum secure digital signatures that are designed with the needs of such constraint {IoT} systems in mind. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight post-quantum digital signature that respects the processing, memory, and bandwidth limitations of resource-limited {IoTs}. Our new scheme, called , efficiently transforms a one-time signature to a (polynomially-bounded) many-time signature via a distributed public key computation method. This new approach enables a resource-limited signer to compute signatures without any costly lattice operations (e.g., rejection samplings, matrix multiplications, etc.), and only with a low-memory footprint and compact signature sizes. We also developed a variant for \&nbsp;with forward-security, which is an extremely costly property to attain via the state-of-the-art post-quantum signatures.},

This article presents an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art in the {IIoT} ecosystem from security and digital forensics perspectives.

	abstract = {Recent achievements in designing quantum computers place a serious threat on the security of state-of-the-art public key cryptography and on all communication that relies on it. Meanwhile, security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power {IoT} devices even with pre-quantum public key cryptography since {IoT} devices have strict energy constraints and limited computational power. Thus, state-of-the-art dedicated hardware accelerators have been deployed to facilitate secure and confidential communication with well established protocols on such devices.It is common belief that the complexity of the cryptographic computations are also the bottleneck of the new, quantum-resistant algorithms and that hardware accelerators are necessary to use them efficiently on energy constrained embedded devices. In this paper, we carried out an in-depth investigation of the application of potential Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms, which were proposed in the associated {US} {NIST} process, to a representative {TLS}-based low-power {IoT} infrastructure.First, we show that the main contributor to the {TLS} handshake latency are the higher bandwidth requirements of post-quantum Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms rather than the cryptographic computations itself. Second, from the perspective of crypto-agility we show that edge devices with code-based, isogeny-based as well as lattice-based algorithms have low energy consumption, which enables long battery run times in typical {IoT} scenarios without dedicated hardware accelerators. Third, we increase the level of security further by combining pre-quantum and post-quantum algorithms to a hybrid key exchange, and quantify the overhead in energy consumption and latency of it.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has long been the main backbone that Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices rely on to accommodate their storage and analytical needs. However, the fact that cloud systems are often located quite far from the {IoT} devices and the emergence of delay-critical {IoT} applications urged the need for extending the cloud architecture to support delay-critical services. Given that fog nodes possess low resource capabilities compared to the cloud, matching the {IoT} services to appropriate fog nodes while guaranteeing minimal delay for {IoT} services and efficient resource utilization on fog nodes becomes quite challenging. In this context, the main limitation of existing approaches is addressing the scheduling problem from one side perspective, i.e., either fog nodes or {IoT} devices. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a multi-criteria intelligent {IoT}-Fog scheduling approach using game theory. Our solution consists of designing (1) preference functions for the {IoT} and fog layers to enable them to rank each other based on several criteria latency and resource utilization and (2) centralized and distributed intelligent scheduling algorithms that capitalize on matching theory and consider the preferences of both parties. Simulation results reveal that our solution outperforms the two common Min-Min and Max-Min scheduling approaches in terms of {IoT} services execution makespan and fog nodes resource consolidation efficiency.},

	abstract = {As the development of quantum computers advances, actors relying on public key infrastructures ({PKI}) for secure information exchange are becoming aware of the disruptive implications. Currently, governments and businesses employ {PKI} for many core processes that may become insecure or unavailable when quantum computers break the cryptographic algorithms foundational to {PKI}. While standardization institutes are currently testing quantum safe cryptographic algorithms, there are no globally agreed-upon cryptographic solutions available. Actors looking to prepare for the implementation of quantum safe cryptographic algorithms lack methods that allow for collective planning and action across organizations, sectors, and nations. The goal of this policy paper is to elicit requirements for a serious game on {QS} {PKI}, and derive policy guidelines that actors can use to prepare and formulate governance arrangements. We followed a two-step approach, drawing on technology threat avoidance theory and collective action theory, followed by empirical grounding through a focus group. The results from the literature confirm that a serious game could be a suitable governance mechanism for {QS} {PKI}. The focus group results discussed 12 requirements and the requirement's relation to the theoretical background. From this, the findings section arrived at four policy guidelines derived from the requirements that can function as focus areas for further requirement development and as input for policy makers. The policy guidelines concluded are (1) prioritize increasing collective awareness through emphasizing social networks, (2) acknowledge the interdependencies in migrating towards {QS} {PKI}, (3) create an understanding of the technical standards in the field and their issuers, and (4) being highly realistic with both negative and positive scenarios to center the players’ understanding of real-world impact.},
