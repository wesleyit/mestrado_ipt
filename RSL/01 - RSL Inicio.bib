	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems ({CPS}) are considered a crucial part for providing connectivity in industrial environments. However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that {CPS} are secured against current and — due to their long life span — also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture ({OPC} {UA}). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms ({KEMs}), namely {NewHope}, {NTRU}, {CRYSTALS}-Kyber, and Saber. We implement our resulting quantum-resistant modifications of {OPC} {UA} on two different {ARM} based platforms and present detailed performance footprints. Finally, we show the feasibility of employing hybrid quantum-resistant key exchange within {OPC} {UA} preserving industrial communication against future threats.},

	abstract = {Although quantum computing is still in its nascent age, its evolution threatens the most popular public-key encryption systems. Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman ({RSA}), elliptic curve cryptography ({ECC}) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security ({TLS}), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to {IoT} devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like {IoT} applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term {IoT} device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat. This article provides a survey on what can be called post-quantum {IoT} systems ({IoT} systems protected from the currently known quantum computing attacks): the main post-quantum cryptosystems and initiatives are reviewed, the most relevant {IoT} architectures and challenges are analyzed, and the expected future trends are indicated. Thus, this article is aimed at providing a wide view of post-quantum {IoT} security and give useful guidelines to the future post-quantum {IoT} developers.},

Quantum computers threaten public key cryptography algorithms like {RSA} (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) and Diffie-Hellman ({DH}) key exchange schemes, which are widely in use today.

However, solutions like Quantum Key Distribution require heavy infrastructure. So, it is not feasible for the Internet of Things with fewer resources in computing power and form factor.

	abstract = {An important enabler of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) is the Narrow-Band Internet of Things ({NB}-{IoT}) technology, which is a 3GPP standards compliant connectivity solution. Quantum computing, another emerging technological paradigm, promises novel compute opportunities but is also able to compromise cybersecurity ciphers. Therefore, improved methods to mitigate such security threats are needed. In this research, we propose a location-aware cryptographic system that guarantees post-quantum {IoT} security. The ultimate value of a location-driven cryptosystem is to use the geographic location as a player’s identity and credential. Position-driven cryptography using lattices is efficient and lightweight, and it can be used to protect sensitive and confidential data in many critical situations that rely heavily on exchanging confidential data. At the best of our knowledge, this research starts the study of unconditional-quantum-resistant-location-driven cryptography by using the Lattice problem for the {IoT} in a pre-and post-quantum world. Unlike existing schemes, the proposed cryptosystem is the first secure and unrestricted position-based protocol that guards against any number of collusion attackers and against quantum attacks. It has a guaranteed authentication process, solves the problems of distributing public keys by removing a public key infrastructure ({PKI}), offers secure {NB}-{IoT} without {SIM} cards, and resists location spoofing attacks. Furthermore, it can be generalized to any network – not just {NB}-{IoT}.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles ({AV}) have as one of their characteristics the constant exchange of data with other vehicles, radio base stations, pedestrians and infrastructure. Despite this data exchange using the most modern security techniques, vehicles have been the target of constant cyber-attacks. Emerging technologies such as quantum computing have been tested to minimize these attacks. Particularly, this work investigates the possibility of using post-quantum computing techniques in {IoT} (Internet of Things) devices, more specifically in {AVs}. Considering the functionalities of a vehicle nowadays, it is possible to say that a vehicle is composed of a set of {IoT} devices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a post-quantum secure method to be used in {IoT} devices for data exchange between {AVs} and a 5G base station. In this method, the post-quantum algorithm {NTRU} is implemented in an edge computing {IoT} architecture between the source of the {CVs} data and the edge layer, which is a vulnerable spot for quantum-attacks. We simulated the implementation of the algorithm in a case study and monitored how the algorithm performed. The proposed methodology was capable of providing secure communication between {IoT} and edge layer. However, the message length and parameters from the algorithm can slow down the communication.},

	abstract = {As the Internet of Things ({IoT}) expands explosively existing network connections, the transmission and processing of private data is facing more serious threats of leakage and theft. Classical public key encryption schemes are difficult to guarantee strong security protection, because the mathematically hard problems they rely on are no longer difficult to solve under the rapid development of quantum computing. Therefore, a more high-performance and quantum-resistant encryption scheme Ring-{ExpLWE} is proposed, in which the error vector is sampled in the exponential distribution instead of the binary distribution in the previous Ring-{BinLWE}. We evaluate the Ring-{ExpLWE}’s security level by analyzing the runtime under quantum hybrid attack and comparing the standard deviation of the noise polynomial coefficients. Compared with Ring-{BinLWE}, the proposed Ring-{ExpLWE} requires larger runtime for quantum hybrid attack and has a more discrete noise distribution. Therefore, Ring-{ExpLWE} can provide a higher security level under the same parameter set. Moreover, the high-performance software and hardware implementations for the Ring-{ExpLWE} scheme are proposed, respectively. Based on the Cortex-M3 microprocessor platform, encryption, and decryption only require 35.6 and 17.8 ms in our software implementation, respectively. Compared with the previous Ring-{BinLWE} schemes, while significantly improving the security level, the Area {\textbackslash}times Time ({AT}) of our high-performance and lightweight hardware implementations is reduced by 49.2\% and 49.5\%, respectively, when the {FPGA} platform is Spartan 6.},

Therefore, post-quantum n-to-n communication encryption is a crucial field of research. Here, the development of new schemes and the analysis, and comparison of existing schemes is necessary. However, current work only investigates the performance of post-quantum schemes only for 1-to-1 communication. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze existing post-quantum schemes concerning n-to-n communication and compare them with pre-quantum schemes. Our results show that the pre-quantum schemes perform better regarding computation times than the post-quantum schemes, but the differences are sometimes only marginal. However, these marginal differences in computation times lead to the lower energy efficiency of the post-quantum schemes. In terms of features, there is no difference between both scheme classes. We show that the post-quantum schemes require unicast, whereas some pre-quantum schemes also support broadcast. Deciding whether to use pre- or post-quantum schemes for n-to-n encryption in {IoT} use cases depends on (i) whether energy efficiency is essential – e.g., in case of limited power supply – and (ii) whether unicast or broadcast is available.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) is gaining ground as a pervasive presence around us by enabling miniaturized “things” with computation and communication capabilities to collect, process, analyze, and interpret information. Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the data generated by these things, for critical decision-making processes, data debugging, risk assessment, forensic analysis, and performance tuning. Currently, secure and reliable data communication in {IoT} is based on public-key cryptosystems such as the elliptic curve cryptosystem ({ECC}). Nevertheless, the reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this article, we investigate applications of one of the postquantum signatures called hash-based signature ({HBS}) schemes for the security of {IoT} devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of {HBS} schemes with an emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of {HBS} schemes and their significance for {IoT} security in the quantum era. We also investigate the optimal selection of {HBS} in the {IoT} networks with respect to their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives. In addition to ongoing standardization efforts, we also highlight current and future research and deployment challenges along with possible solutions. Finally, we outline the essential measures and recommendations that must be adopted by the {IoT} ecosystem while preparing for the quantum world.},

The Gaussian sampler is a crucial part in lattice-based post-quantum cryptosystems, thus being the most vulnerable module to side-channel attack as well. However, research on the countermeasures for the Gaussian sampler against power side-channel attacks is almost blank. In this article, a flexible and generic cumulative distribution table ({CDT})-based Gaussian sampler using the hardware-software approach is proposed. The proposed {CDT} sampler has an {AHB} interface and can be reconfigured to support various parameter sets, while utilizing just 77 Slices on a Xilinx Spartan-6 {FPGA} with constant response time. Additionally, the first simple power analysis ({SPA}) attack on the {CDT} sampler is presented. The presented attack mainly takes advantage of the chosen input and the {SPA} vulnerability associated with the binary search method, hence the attacker is able to recover every sampled value by comparing a few pairs of power consumption traces. To further protect against chosen input {SPA} attack, this article identifies the vulnerability associated with three main operations in every binary search state and construct an effective countermeasure based on randomization at the cost of only extra 58.4\% Slices. Compared to other related works, the merits of the proposed {CDT} sampler are the high hardware flexibility, side-channel security, and suitability for resource-constrained {IoT} nodes.},

In the last decade, lattice-based cryptography has been a progenitor platform of the post-quantum cryptography ({PQC}) due to its lower complexity, which makes it more suitable for Internet of Things applications. In this article, we propose an efficient implementation of the binary learning with errors over ring (Ring-{BinLWE}) on the reduced instruction set computer-five ({RISC}-V) platform. Our field-programmable gate array ({FPGA}) implementations improve the speed of scheme operations by more than 51\% in terms of {CPU} cycles compared to previous work. The proposed hardware module has low complexity and only imposes around 6\%–9\% overhead to the original core. Moreover, it has constant-time operations and is resistant to timing attacks. Besides, a more reliable fault-resilient variant of the architecture with 1\% area overhead is proposed.

	abstract = {Digital signatures provide scalable authentication with non-repudiation and therefore are vital tools for the Internet of Things ({IoT}). {IoT} applications harbor vast quantities of low-end devices that are expected to operate for long periods with a risk of compromise. Hence, {IoT} needs post-quantum cryptography ({PQC}) that respects the resource limitations of low-end devices while offering compromise resiliency (e.g., forward-security). However, as seen in {NIST} {PQC} efforts, quantum-safe signatures are extremely costly for low-end {IoT}. These costs become prohibitive when forward security is considered. We propose a highly lightweight post-quantum digital signature called {HArdware}-Supported Efficient Signature ({HASES}) that meets the stringent requirements of resource-limited signers (processor, memory, bandwidth) with forward security. {HASES} transforms a key-evolving one-time hash-based signature into a polynomially unbounded one by introducing a public key oracle via secure enclaves. The signer is non-interactive and only generates a few hashes per signature. Unlike existing hardware-supported alternatives, {HASES} does not require a secure-hardware on the signer, which is infeasible for low-end {IoT}. {HASES} also does not assume non-colluding servers that permit scalable verification. We proved that {HASES} is secure and implemented it on the commodity hardware and the 8-bit {AVR} {ATmega}2560 microcontroller. Our experiments confirm that {HASES} is 271{\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathbfand{\textbackslash} 34{\textbackslash}times faster than (forward-secure) {XMSS} and (plain) Dilithium. {HASES} is more than twice and magnitude more energy-efficient than (forward-secure) {ANT} and (plain) {BLISS}, respectively, on an 8-bit device. We open-source {HASES} for public testing and adaptation.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has revolutionized organizational operations by providing convenient, on-demand access to resources. The emergence of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) has introduced a new paradigm for collaborative computing, leveraging sensors and devices that generate and process vast amounts of data, thereby resulting in challenges related to scalability and security, making the significance of conventional security methods even more pronounced. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a novel Scalable and Secure Cloud Architecture ({SSCA}) that integrates {IoT} and cryptographic techniques, aiming to develop scalable and trustworthy cloud systems, thus enabling multi-user systems and facilitating simultaneous access to cloud resources by multiple users. The design adopts a decentralized approach, utilizing multiple cloud nodes to handle user requests efficiently and incorporates Multicast and Broadcast Rekeying Algorithm ({MBRA}) to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of user information, utilizing a hybrid cryptosystem that combines {MBRA}, Post Quantum Cryptography ({PQC}) and blockchain technology. Leveraging {IoT} devices, the architecture gathers data from distributed sensing resources and ensures the security of collected information through robust {MBRA}-{PQC} encryption algorithms, while the blockchain ensures that the confidential data is stored in distributed and immutable records. The proposed approach is applied to several datasets and the effectiveness is validated through various performance metrics, including response time, throughput, scalability, security, and reliability. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed {SSCA}, showcasing a notable reduction in response time by 1.67 seconds and 0.97 seconds for 250 and 1000 devices, respectively, in comparison to the {MHE}-{IS}-{CPMT}. Likewise, {SSCA} demonstrated significant improvements in the {AUC} values, exhibiting enhancements of 6.30\%, 6.90\%, 7.60\%, and 7.30\% at the 25-user level, and impressive gains of 5.20\%, 9.30\%, 11.50\%, and 15.40\% at the 50-user level when compared to the {MHE}-{IS}-{CPMT}, {EAM}, {SCSS}, and {SHCEF} models, respectively.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is becoming increasingly popular in the business and academic communities because it can provide security for a wide range of applications. Therefore, researchers have been motivated to exploit blockchain characteristics, such as data immutability, transparency, and resistance to single-point failures in the Internet of Things ({IoT}), to increase the security of the {IoT} ecosystem. However, many existing blockchains rely on classical cryptosystems such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ({ECDSA}) and {SHA}-256 to validate transactions, which will be compromised by Shor and Grover’s algorithms running on quantum computers in the foreseeable future. Post-Quantum Cryptosystems ({PQC}) are an innovative solution for resisting quantum attacks that can be applied to blockchains, resulting in the creation of a new type of blockchain known as Post-Quantum Blockchains ({PQB}). In this survey, we will look at the different types of {PQC} and their recent standard primitives to determine whether they can enable security for blockchain-based {IoT} applications. It also briefly introduces blockchain and outlines recent blockchain-{IoT} application proposals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine how post-quantum blockchains are being developed and how they can be used to create security mechanisms for different {IoT} applications. Finally, this study explores the main challenges and potential research directions that arise from integrating quantum-resistance blockchains into {IoT} ecosystems.},

All the traditional {PKC} should be replaced with {PQC} for secure communications in post-quantum era.

	abstract = {5th Generation(5G)-enabled Internet of Things ({IoT}) connects billions of devices for high -speed data transfer. The data collected fuel many automation applications such as smart cities, industrial automation 5.0, autonomous vehicles and healthcare sectors. However, the critical challenges concerning such an environment are Open Web Security and Mutual Authentication. The recent security protocols of {IoT} are based on hard mathematical cryptographic structures. Nevertheless, dependency on the security of classical cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by Quantum Computing. Recent Quantum attacks on {IoT} security have motivated us to survey Quantum-resistant solutions comprehensively. Therefore in this paper, we analysed how the technology shifts from classical cryptographic techniques towards quantum-enabled solutions to achieve end-to-end security. The main objective of this survey is to provide a systematic roadmap in the area of Quantum secured 5G-enabled {IoT} communication by covering current research on 5G-enabled {IoT} with its key enabling technologies, threats imposed on 5G-enabled {IoT} applications, state-of-the-art quantum-based solutions and initiatives. A detailed overview of the quantum computing preliminaries, Post Quantum Cryptography ({PQC}) schemes, Quantum Cryptography ({QC}), and Quantum Key Distribution ({QKD}) with their significant advantage in securing {IoT}-enabled communication over classical scenarios are also presented. Particularly, we emphasize Post-Quantum resistant techniques that must be used soon to secure 5G-enabled {IoT} communications. The comparative analysis of quantum-resistant schemes with classical cryptographic schemes in terms of key size, data size, time complexity and impact of quantum computers on these schemes are discussed. This paper identifies the technical challenges in Quantum-based schemes and provides future research directions to enable Post-Quantum resistant cryptography for secure communication in 5G-enabled {IoT}.},

	abstract = {The prospect of large-scale quantum computers necessitates the design, development, and standardization of post-quantum cryptography ({PQC}). Industrial control systems ({ICS}) and critical infrastructures are expected to be among the first industrial environments to adopt {PQC}. As their components have a long life span ({\textgreater}= 10 years) and are increasingly interconnected to form an Industrial Internet of Things ({IIoT}), they require strong and long-lasting security guarantees. Because of these high-security requirements, {IIoT} products are also increasingly equipped with additional hardware security elements - often Trusted Platform Modules ({TPMs}). In this work, we study how the current {TPM} 2.0 specification can supplement the migration towards {PQC}. Therefore, we integrate the post-quantum ({PQ}) key exchange {CRYSTALS}-Kyber, the post-quantum signature scheme {SPHINCS}+, and {TPM} functionality into the open-source {TLS} library Mbed {TLS}. For our performance evaluations we propose three post-quantum {TLS} cipher suites alongside two different {TPM} utilization strategies. We report the standalone performance of the aforementioned post-quantum schemes under our proposed {TPM} utilizations and compare it to current elliptic curve cryptography ({ECC}). Finally, we report the handshake duration of post-quantum and mutually authenticated {TLS} ({mTLS}) connections for our proposed cipher suites with regards to the different {TPM} utilization scenarios. Our results show that the integration of {PQC} into {mTLS} is generally feasible, thus ensuring additional post-quantum client authentication. Regarding our {TPM} utilizations, we observe a significant decrease in performance when offloading computations of hash functions. However, offloading the generation of random numbers to {TPMs} in our integrated post-quantum schemes proves to be efficient, ultimately enhancing overall system security.},

	doi = {10.3390/s21051883},
	abstract = {Postquantum cryptography for elevating security against attacks by quantum computers in the Internet of Everything ({IoE}) is still in its infancy. Most postquantum based cryptosystems have longer keys and signature sizes and require more computations that span several orders of magnitude in energy consumption and computation time, hence the sizes of the keys and signature are considered as another aspect of security by green design. To address these issues, the security solutions should migrate to the advanced and potent methods for protection against quantum attacks and offer energy efficient and faster cryptocomputations. In this context, a novel security framework Lightweight Postquantum {ID}-based Signature ({LPQS}) for secure communication in the {IoE} environment is presented. The proposed {LPQS} framework incorporates a supersingular isogeny curve to present a digital signature with small key sizes which is quantum-resistant. To reduce the size of the keys, compressed curves are used and the validation of the signature depends on the commutative property of the curves. The unforgeability of {LPQS} under an adaptively chosen message attack is proved. Security analysis and the experimental validation of {LPQS} are performed under a realistic software simulation environment to assess its lightweight performance considering embedded nodes. It is evident that the size of keys and the signature of {LPQS} is smaller than that of existing signature-based postquantum security techniques for {IoE}. It is robust in the postquantum environment and efficient in terms of energy and computations.},

This threatens the security of any cryptographic system which often relies on the difficulty of factorisation.

For a cryptographic system to remain secure against a quantum adversary, we need to build methods based on a hard mathematical problem, which are not susceptible to Shor's algorithm and create Post Quantum Cryptography ({PQC}). While high-powered computing devices may be able to run these new methods, we need to investigate how well these methods run on limited powered devices. This paper outlines an evaluation framework for {PQC} within constrained devices, and contributes to the area by providing benchmarks of the front-running algorithms on a popular single-board low-power device. It also introduces a set of five notions which can be considered to determine the robustness of particular algorithms.},

The research results show that it is known that the application of link encryption algorithm in network communication security encryption algorithm can increase the security index by 25\%, the node encryption algorithm can increase the security index by 35\%, and the end-to-end encryption algorithm can make the cyber activity safety index to increase by 40\%. Among them, {RSA} algorithm and {DES} algorithm are two very representative algorithms; they represent different encryption systems. From the perspective of network data link, there are three methods of encryption algorithm, namely, link encryption algorithm, node encryption algorithm, and end-to-end encryption algorithm.},

Being cost effective and easy to deploy, they are also considered for many applications outside their original domain, which was consumer electronics. Factory and process automation, smart buildings and homes, and, in general, Industry 4.0 are application fields in which the use of {IoT} technology is gaining popularity, often in addition to existing, classical communication architectures on the operational technology level. {IoT} devices, however, typically have a different philosophy for communication and data exchange, which makes them easy to use but poses security challenges by bypassing established security architectures, such as the classical defense-in-depth concept defined, for instance, in the {IEC} 62443 standard. This letter highlights today's security needs and concepts in industrial environments. Furthermore, it looks at possible new attack surfaces opened by {IoT}-based applications and shows ways how to bridge the security gap.},

	abstract = {Fog computing is an intermediate computing layer that has emerged to address the latency issues of cloud-based Internet of things ({IoT}) environments. As a result, new forms of security and privacy threats are emerging. These threats are mainly due to the huge number of sensors, as well as the enormous amount of data generated in {IoT} environments that needs to be processed in real time. These sensors send data to the cloud through the fog computing layer, creating an additional layer of vulnerabilities. In addition, the cloud by nature is vulnerable because cloud services can be located in different geographical locations and provided by multiple service providers. Moreover, cloud services can be hybrid and public, which exposes them to risks due to their infinite number of anonymous users. Access control ({AC}) is one of the essential prevention measures to protect data and services in computing environments. Many {AC} models have been implemented by researchers from academia and industry to address the problems associated with data breaches in pervasive computing environments. However, the question of which {AC} model(s) should be used to prevent unauthorized access to data remains. The selection of {AC} models for cloud-based {IoT} environments is highly dependent on the application requirements and how the {AC} models can impact the computation overhead. In this paper, we survey the features and challenges of {AC} models in the fog computing environment. We also discuss the diversity of different {AC} models. This survey provides the reader with state-of-the-art practices in the field of fog computing {AC} and helps to identify the existing gaps within the field.},

In this context, several efforts are initiated to deal with the evolving security issues in {IoT} systems and make them self-sufficient to harvest energy for smooth functioning. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we explore the evolving vulnerabilities in {IoT} devices. We provide a state-of-the-art survey that addresses multiple dimensions of the {IoT} realm.

With the rapid advancement of quantum computing technologies, it has become imperative to identify and standardize new cryptographic techniques that can withstand attacks from quantum computers. This paper explores the motivation behind {PQC} and provides an overview of the experimental research conducted in the field. It highlights the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptographic algorithms, such as {RSA} and {ECC}, to quantum attacks and emphasizes the need for transitioning to quantum-resistant alternatives. The experiments conducted in the {PQC} domain encompass the evaluation and analysis of candidate algorithms submitted to the {NIST} {PQC} competition. These experiments involve comprehensive security assessments, performance evaluations, and code audits to ensure the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in real-world scenarios. This paper provides guidelines for organizations and practitioners adopting {PQC}. It discusses considerations for selecting and implementing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, including security levels, algorithmic characteristics, performance tradeoffs, and integration challenges. It also outlines the importance of a smooth transition from classical to post-quantum cryptographic systems and highlights the need for standardization efforts to ensure interoperability and compatibility.},

Cryptographic methods, once deemed secure for decades, are now at risk of being compromised, posing a massive threat to the security of sensitive data and communications across enterprises worldwide. As a result, there is an urgent need to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems. This is no simple task. Migrating to a quantum-safe state is a complex process, and many organisations lack the in-house expertise to navigate this transition without guidance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework designed to assist enterprises with this migration. Our framework outlines essential steps involved in the cryptographic migration process, and leverages existing organisational inventories. The framework facilitates the efficient identification of cryptographic assets and can be integrated with other enterprise frameworks smoothly. To underscore its practicality and effectiveness, we have incorporated case studies that utilise graph-theoretic techniques to pinpoint and assess cryptographic dependencies. This is useful in prioritising crypto-systems for replacement.},

These changes may be driven by regulatory action, advances in computing, or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Yet everyday operational needs may put crypto agility considerations on the back burner when deploying technology, designing processes, or developing products/services. Consequently, changes are often performed in an ad hoc manner. Transition from one crypto solution to another can then take a long time and expose organizations to unnecessary security risk. This paper presents a framework to analyze and evaluate the risk that results from the lack of crypto agility. The proposed framework can be used by organizations to determine an appropriate mitigation strategy commensurate with their risk tolerance. We demonstrate the application of this framework with a case study of quantum computing and related threats to cryptography in the context of {TLS} for Internet of Things.},

	abstract = {Blockchain offers a distributed ledger to record data collected from Internet of Thing ({IoT}) devices as immutable and tamper-proof transactions and securely shared among authorized participants in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. Despite the growing interest in using blockchain for securing {IoT} systems, there is a general lack of systematic research and comprehensive review of the design issues on the integration of blockchain and {IoT} from the software architecture perspective. This article presents a catalog of architectural tactics for the design of {IoT} systems supported by blockchain as a result of a Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) on {IoT} and blockchain to extract the commonly reported quality attributes, design decisions, and relevant architectural tactics for the architectural design of this category of systems. Our findings are threefold:\&lt;?brk?\&gt; (i) identification of security, scalability, performance, and interoperability as the commonly reported quality attributes; (ii) a catalog of twelve architectural tactics for the design of {IoT} systems supported by blockchain; and (iii) gaps in research that include tradeoffs among quality attributes and identified tactics. These tactics might provide architects and designers with different options when searching for an optimal architectural design that meets the quality attributes of interest and constraints of a system.},

	abstract = {A digital signature is an essential cryptographic tool to offer authentication with public verifiability, non-repudiation, and scalability. However, digital signatures often rely on expensive operations that can be highly costly for low-end devices, typically seen in the Internet of Things and Systems ({IoTs}). These efficiency concerns especially deepen when post-quantum secure digital signatures are considered. Hence, it is of vital importance to devise post-quantum secure digital signatures that are designed with the needs of such constraint {IoT} systems in mind. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight post-quantum digital signature that respects the processing, memory, and bandwidth limitations of resource-limited {IoTs}. Our new scheme, called , efficiently transforms a one-time signature to a (polynomially-bounded) many-time signature via a distributed public key computation method. This new approach enables a resource-limited signer to compute signatures without any costly lattice operations (e.g., rejection samplings, matrix multiplications, etc.), and only with a low-memory footprint and compact signature sizes. We also developed a variant for \&nbsp;with forward-security, which is an extremely costly property to attain via the state-of-the-art post-quantum signatures.},

	abstract = {Recently, blockchain has received much attention from the mobility-centric Internet of Things ({IoT}). It is deemed the key to ensuring the built-in integrity of information and security of immutability by design in the peer-to-peer network (P2P) of mobile devices. In a permissioned blockchain, the authority of the system has control over the identities of its users. Such information can allow an ill-intentioned authority to map identities with their spatiotemporal data, which undermines the location privacy of a mobile user. In this paper, we study the location privacy preservation problem in the context of permissioned blockchain-based {IoT} systems under three conditions. First, the authority of the blockchain holds the public and private key distribution task in the system. Second, there exists a spatiotemporal correlation between consecutive location-based transactions. Third, users communicate with each other through short-range communication technologies such that it constitutes a proof of location ({PoL}) on their actual locations. We show that, in a permissioned blockchain with an authority and a presence of a {PoL}, existing approaches cannot be applied using a plug-and-play approach to protect location privacy. In this context, we propose {BlockPriv}, an obfuscation technique that quantifies, both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship between privacy and utility in order to dynamically protect the privacy of sensitive locations in the permissioned blockchain.},

	abstract = {{LiFi}, light-fidelity, is a wireless technology that uses visible light for data transmission. It has several advantages, such as using a different part of electromagnetic spectrum than radio communication and providing enhanced privacy because light transmission is blocked by walls. Internet of Things applications with low-to-moderate data rates represent a promising arena for {LiFi} adoption. However, it is difficult to bring {LiFi} to {IoT} devices for several reasons, including some of {LiFi}'s strengths. We present {TunnelLiFi}, a new receiver architecture that acts like a bridge between the light and radio spectrums. A key aspect of {TunnelLiFi}'s design is the use of the unique self-oscillating mixing property of the tunnel diode oscillator, which enables the mixing of a photodiode signal with a locally generated radio frequency carrier signal while drawing under 100 μW of power consumption. In our experiments, Tunnel-{LiFi} demonstrates the ability to replicate the information contained in light signals onto radio signals at tens of microwatts, even in low-light conditions (300 lux) and at low bitrates (2.93 Kbps). We also show the potential of {TunnelLiFi} to support high bitrates. {TunnelLiFi} opens up new possibilities for {LiFi} technology by enabling communication in areas where light propagation is challenging. It also allows commodity {IoT} devices to receive {LiFi} transmissions using their existing transceivers, thus expanding the reach of {LiFi}.},

	abstract = {The application of Information and Communication Technologies ({ICTs}) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of {IoT} and {AI}. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as {KisanOne} by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. "Kisan One" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces ({APIs}). Needless to say, the proposed {KisanOne} is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of {KisanOne} both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of {IoT} and {AI} in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, {mKisan} {SMS} Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System({FMS}) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using {IoT} and {AI} is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing {IoT} and {AI} in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of {IoT} and {AI} in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.},

The protocol is specifically tailored to be used in the context of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) to address the security risks posed by quantum computing to classical protocols. Our approach replaces the classical protocol with a quantum-safe watchdog timer protocol, which ensures that an {IoT} device’s communication channels remain secure from adversarial attacks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed protocol, we develop a proof-of-concept ({PoC}) implementation using an actor framework in Python. We evaluate the performance impact of the proposed protocol based on several {IoT} scenarios. We also compare the performance of different quantum-safe algorithms using measurements of {CPU} cycles, and quantitatively evaluate the results using statistical methods. Our results indicate that the performance of the tested quantum-safe algorithms is better or similar to that of the tested classical algorithms. Based on these results, we recommend a specific quantum-safe algorithm for use with the watchdog timer protocol in the {IoT} context. The proposed protocol and recommended quantum-safe algorithm offer an effective way to address the security risks posed by quantum computing to {IoT} devices, and are a significant contribution to the field of quantum-safe cryptography.},

To increase the network's capability to support a large number of active devices accessing a network concurrently, this work presents {IoT}-{ResQ}, a warm-started quantum annealing-based multi-device detector via quantum reverse annealing ({RA}). Unlike in typical quantum forward annealing ({FA}) protocol, {IoT}-{ResQ}'s {RA} starts its search operation on a controllable candidate classical state, instead of a quantum superposition, and thus allows refined local quantum search around the initial state. This procedure can provide an opportunity of utilizing both conventional classical- and quantum-based detectors together in a hybrid synergy, to boost quantum optimization performance, mitigating the effect of quantum decoherence and noise on quantum hardware. In our evaluation, {IoT}-{ResQ} achieves nearly two to three orders of magnitude better {BER} and over 2X packet success rate with packet size of 32-byte compared to other quantum and conventional detectors at {SNR} 9 {dB} to support 48 active {IoT} devices with {QPSK} modulation (implying 48,000 deployed devices with 0.1\% wake-up radio rate at a time), requiring ≈ 140 μs pure compute time for detection.},

	abstract = {Recent achievements in designing quantum computers place a serious threat on the security of state-of-the-art public key cryptography and on all communication that relies on it. Meanwhile, security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power {IoT} devices even with pre-quantum public key cryptography since {IoT} devices have strict energy constraints and limited computational power. Thus, state-of-the-art dedicated hardware accelerators have been deployed to facilitate secure and confidential communication with well established protocols on such devices.It is common belief that the complexity of the cryptographic computations are also the bottleneck of the new, quantum-resistant algorithms and that hardware accelerators are necessary to use them efficiently on energy constrained embedded devices. In this paper, we carried out an in-depth investigation of the application of potential Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms, which were proposed in the associated {US} {NIST} process, to a representative {TLS}-based low-power {IoT} infrastructure.First, we show that the main contributor to the {TLS} handshake latency are the higher bandwidth requirements of post-quantum Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms rather than the cryptographic computations itself. Second, from the perspective of crypto-agility we show that edge devices with code-based, isogeny-based as well as lattice-based algorithms have low energy consumption, which enables long battery run times in typical {IoT} scenarios without dedicated hardware accelerators. Third, we increase the level of security further by combining pre-quantum and post-quantum algorithms to a hybrid key exchange, and quantify the overhead in energy consumption and latency of it.},

	abstract = {The number of Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices is increasing since they can solve many problems, such as those found in healthcare or power grid. Since they are susceptible to be attacked, solutions must be explored to make them more trustworthy and, thus, increment the confidence of their users. It is common that trusted devices use secret keys to achieve confidentiality of data stored in non-volatile memory, data in transit, and to authenticate themselves to other parties. However, these keys can be compromised if an attacker takes control of the platform by exploiting some vulnerability. In this work, we propose to seal the secret keys to the platform and to a specific state, mainly associated with the memory content and determined in a development stage. The secret keys are encrypted with a Sealing Secret Key that is not stored in the device, but obfuscated with an {SRAM} {PUF}, making it more secure. When a secret key has to be sealed or unsealed, functions called seal() and unseal() are employed. They have atomic execution and are stored in a {ROM} memory. Their goal is to measure the state of the platform and recuperate the sealing secret key only if the measurement matches a valid one signed by the application developer. As quantum computers are emerging and future {IoT} devices must be resistant to attacks performed by them, we choose Dilithium and Saturnin as cryptographic primitives. Benchmarking results taken in an {ESP}32 microcontroller show the suitability of the proposal for an {IoT} device.},

Nevertheless, the shared data between doctor and patient should be protected from leaking, and not be divulged to the public.

After that, the survey identifies the {IoTBD} challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions {IoTBD} as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address {IoTBD} challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions.

We review the unique challenges that {IoT} manufacturers face in extending device lifetimes, and identify software and security updates as a key requirement for device longevity. We propose a new {IoT} device software stack and lifecycle that allows devices to continue safe operation even after the vendor disappears.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) application ecosystem is driven by third party developers outside of the telecom domain. Edge infrastructure of communication service providers will therefore be accessible to third party application providers and developers and will host a multitude of application each with different characteristics. We foresee that multiple business actors will contribute to an {IoT} and edge-ecosystem including Hyperscale Cloud Providers ({HCPs}), Operation Technology ({OT}) vendors, communication service providers, and application developers. To reduce cost, efficient use of resources are needed across all business actors. End users, especially in {IoT} deployment, will look for pay-as-use (elasticity) service offerings similar to {IT} cloud offerings. Therefore, the layers of orchestration services must be able to elastically resize their respective resource pools by the means of initiating re-configurations via the underlay providers' orchestration services. We propose a workload placement algorithm, which can reconfigure both cloud (e.g., Infrastructure as a Service) and network (e.g., Virtual Private Network) resource underlays during resource orchestration. Our proposed method ensures that different business actors can exercise elastic control of their resources, so their committed services and bought resources are in better (best) alignment. The proposed method is functionally evaluated with 5G network slicing with local break-out to an {IoT} stack in the network edge.},

	abstract = {Industrial {IoT} offers several challenges compared to commodity {IoT}: safety and fault tolerance requirements, resource management, constrained environments and bandwidth, etc. However, as the deployment of industrial {IoT} is, more and more, built on (semi-)autonomous edge devices such as mobile robots, new opportunities to improve operational features emerge. We explore embedding autonomous mobile robots, responsible for effecting work in an industrial environment, within the industrial {IoT} resource management sub-system. This approach brings resource management closer to the edge, lending itself to more distributed intelligence, compared to cloud/fog-only solutions. Specifically, we demonstrate that intelligent autonomous mobile robots can cooperate, sharing energy with one another to minimize: (1) hard failures; situations where robots are left inert, after their energy is completely depleted, resulting in safety concerns and impeding other robots’ actions; and (2) soft failures: where robots are idle, performing no useful work, as a consequence of having to wait for the availability of charging stations. We evaluate this hypothesis using simulation techniques. Results suggest cooperative energy management is effective in increasing productivity and reducing the number of inert robots that require intervention to recover from hard failures, when the strategy is applied only to robots that have become inert. Interestingly, applying energy sharing indiscriminately (to both inert and idle robots) results in negative consequences. Thus, our results suggest cooperative energy management is a promising technique to improve industrial {IoT}, but must be applied strategically after evaluating operational properties, through either empirical or simulation methods.},

In this introductory effort, we prove that underwriting simple cyber re-insurance policies can be worst case computationally hard, i.e., {NP}-Hard, especially for upcoming {IoT} societies. More specifically, let alone human underwriters, even a computer cannot compute an optimal cyber re-insurance policy in a reasonable amount of time in worst case scenarios. Here, optimality of a contract is judged based on the extent of information asymmetry induced negative externalities it mitigates between a re-insurance seller and a buyer. Our result does not challenge the existence of cyber re-insurance markets that we feel will be a necessity in the {IoT} age, but only rationalizes why their growth might be slow, and would subsequently need regulatory intervention. As a direct applicability of our methodology, we argue that optimal traditional cyber-insurance underwriting in {IoT} societies is also {NP}-Hard.},

However, the fact that cloud systems are often located quite far from the {IoT} devices and the emergence of delay-critical {IoT} applications urged the need for extending the cloud architecture to support delay-critical services. Given that fog nodes possess low resource capabilities compared to the cloud, matching the {IoT} services to appropriate fog nodes while guaranteeing minimal delay for {IoT} services and efficient resource utilization on fog nodes becomes quite challenging. In this context, the main limitation of existing approaches is addressing the scheduling problem from one side perspective, i.e., either fog nodes or {IoT} devices. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a multi-criteria intelligent {IoT}-Fog scheduling approach using game theory. Our solution consists of designing (1) preference functions for the {IoT} and fog layers to enable them to rank each other based on several criteria latency and resource utilization and (2) centralized and distributed intelligent scheduling algorithms that capitalize on matching theory and consider the preferences of both parties. Simulation results reveal that our solution outperforms the two common Min-Min and Max-Min scheduling approaches in terms of {IoT} services execution makespan and fog nodes resource consolidation efficiency.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) is playing a promising role in e-healthcare applications in the recent decades; nevertheless, security is one of the crucial challenges in the current field of study. Many healthcare devices (for instance, a sensor-augmented insulin pump and heart-rate sensor) collect a user’s real-time data (such as glucose level and heart rate) and send them to the cloud for proper analysis and diagnosis of the user. However, the real-time user’s data are vulnerable to various authentication attacks while sending through an insecure channel. Besides that, the attacks may further open scope for many other subsequent attacks. Existing security mechanisms concentrate on two-party mutual authentication. However, an {IoT}-enabled healthcare application involves multiple parties such as a patient, e-healthcare test-equipment, doctors, and cloud servers that requires multi-party authentication for secure communication. Moreover, the design and implementation of a lightweight security mechanism that fits into the resource constraint {IoT}-enabled healthcare devices are challenging. Therefore, this article proposes a lightweight, multi-party authentication and key-establishment protocol in {IoT}-based e-healthcare service access network to counter the attacks in resource constraint devices. The proposed multi-party protocol has used a lattice-based cryptographic construct such as Identity-Based Encryption ({IBE}) to acquire security, privacy, and efficiency. The study provided all-round analysis of the scheme, such as security, power consumption, and practical usage, in the following ways. The proposed scheme is tested by a formal security tool, Scyther, to testify the security properties of the protocol. In addition, security analysis for various attacks and comparison with other existing works are provided to show the robust security characteristics. Further, an experimental evaluation of the proposed scheme using {IBE} cryptographic construct is provided to validate the practical usage. The power consumption of the scheme is also computed and compared with existing works to evaluate its efficiency.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption has been a big challenge for electronic devices, particularly for battery-powered Internet of Things ({IoT}) equipment. To address such a challenge, on the one hand, low-power electronic design methodologies and novel power management techniques have been proposed, such as nonvolatile memories and instantly on/off systems; on the other hand, the energy harvesting technology by collecting signals from human activity or the environment has attracted widespread attention in the {IoT} area. However, the system with self-powered energy harvesting may suffer frequent energy failures or fluctuating energy conditions, which degrade system reliability and user experience. Therefore, how to make the system under unreliable power inputs operate correctly and efficiently is one of the most critical issues for energy harvesting technology. In this article, we built an instantly on/off system based on nonvolatile {STT}-{MRAM} for {IoT} applications, which can instantly power on/off under different conditions of the harvested energy. The system powers on and operates normally when the harvested energy is enough (over the preset threshold); otherwise, the system powers off and stores the operational data back to the nonvolatile {STT}-{MRAM}. We described implementations of the hardware/software co-designed architecture (with image acquisition as an example) based on the commercialized 32 {MB} {STT}-{MRAM}, and we experimentally demonstrated the system functionality and efficiency under five typical energy harvesting scenarios, including radio frequency, thermal, solar, piezoelectric, and {WIFI}. Our experimental results show that the power consumption and data restore time were reduced by\&nbsp;15.1\% and\&nbsp;714 times, respectively, in comparison with the {DRAM}-based counterpart.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, {IoT} has gained huge momentum in terms of technological exploration, integration, and its various applications even after having a resource-bound architecture. It is challenging to run any high-end security protocol(s) on Edge devices. These devices are highly vulnerable toward numerous cyber-attacks. {IoT} network nodes need peer-to-peer security, which is possible if there exists proper mutual authentication among network devices. A secure session key needs to be established among source and destination nodes before sending the sensitive data. To generate these session keys, a strong cryptosystem is required to share parameters securely over a wireless network. In this article, we utilize a Rubik's cube puzzle-based cryptosystem to exchange parameters among peers and generate session key(s). Blockchain technology is incorporated in the proposed model to provide anonymity of token transactions, on the basis of which the network devices exchange services. A session key pool randomizer is used to avoid network probabilistic attacks. Our hybrid model is capable of generating secure session keys that can be used for mutual authentication and reliable data transferring tasks. Cyber-attacks resistance and performance results were verified using standard tools, which gave industry level promising results in terms of efficiency, light weightiness, and practical applications.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) firmware upgrade has turned out to be a challenging task with respect to security. While Over-The-Air ({OTA}) software upgrade possibility is an essential feature to achieve security, it is also most sensitive to attacks and lots of different firmware upgrade attacks have been presented in the literature. Several security solutions exist to tackle these problems. We observe though that most prior art solutions are public key-based, they are not flexible with respect to firmware image distribution principles and it is challenging to make a design with good Denial-Of-Service ({DoS}) attacks resistance. Apart from often being rather resource demanding, a limitation with current public key-based solutions is that they are not quantum computer resistant. Hence, in this paper, we take a new look into the firmware upgrade problem and propose {RoSym}, a secure, firmware distribution principle agnostic, and {DoS} protected upgrade mechanism purely based on symmetric cryptography. We present an experimental evaluation on a real testbed environment for the scheme. The results show that the scheme is efficient in comparison to other state of the art solutions. We also make a formal security verification of {RoSym} showing that it is robust against different attacks.},

	abstract = {The shortcomings of the traditional password-based authentication mechanism are becoming increasingly apparent as we transition from "one user - one device" to a richer "multiple users - multiple devices" computing paradigm. The currently dominant research direction focuses on on-device biometrics, which require sensitive information, such as images of a user's face, to be constantly streamed from a single recording source, often the device on which a user is getting authenticated. Instead, in this work we explore the possibilities offered by heterogeneous devices that opportunistically collect non-sensitive data in smart environments. We construct an {IoT} testbed in which we gather data pertaining to a person's movement in space, interaction with certain physical objects, {PC} terminal usage, and keyboard typing, and construct machine learning models capturing the person's behaviour traits. We commence our examination with models constructed from data sensed during a previously-completed task run and with such models we achieve up to 68\% user identification accuracy (c.f. 7\% baseline) among up to 20 individuals. Taking into account the limits of behaviour persistence we then revise our approach to continuously refine the model with the most recently sampled sensor data. This method allows us to achieve 99.3\% user verification accuracy and successfully prevent a session takeover attack within 12 seconds with less than 1\% of false attack detection.},

The hash algorithm is the current foundation for data integrity and authentication. However, it is challenging to provide a high-performance, high-throughput, and energy-efficient solution on resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose Inhale, an in-{SRAM} architecture to effectively compute hash algorithms with innovative data alignment and efficient read/write strategies to implicitly execute data shift operations through the in-situ controller. We present two variations of Inhale: Inhale-Opt, which is optimized for latency, throughput, and area-overhead; and Inhale-Flex, which offers flexibility in repurposing a part of last-level caches for hash computation. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed architectures on both {SRAM} and {ReRAM} memories and compare them with the state-of-the-art in-memory and {ASIC} accelerators. Our performance evaluation confirms that Inhale can achieve 1.4× - 14.5× higher throughput-per-area and about two-orders-of-magnitude higher throughput-per-area-per-energy compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.},

	abstract = {As the development of quantum computers advances, actors relying on public key infrastructures ({PKI}) for secure information exchange are becoming aware of the disruptive implications. Currently, governments and businesses employ {PKI} for many core processes that may become insecure or unavailable when quantum computers break the cryptographic algorithms foundational to {PKI}. While standardization institutes are currently testing quantum safe cryptographic algorithms, there are no globally agreed-upon cryptographic solutions available. Actors looking to prepare for the implementation of quantum safe cryptographic algorithms lack methods that allow for collective planning and action across organizations, sectors, and nations. The goal of this policy paper is to elicit requirements for a serious game on {QS} {PKI}, and derive policy guidelines that actors can use to prepare and formulate governance arrangements. We followed a two-step approach, drawing on technology threat avoidance theory and collective action theory, followed by empirical grounding through a focus group. The results from the literature confirm that a serious game could be a suitable governance mechanism for {QS} {PKI}. The focus group results discussed 12 requirements and the requirement's relation to the theoretical background. From this, the findings section arrived at four policy guidelines derived from the requirements that can function as focus areas for further requirement development and as input for policy makers. The policy guidelines concluded are (1) prioritize increasing collective awareness through emphasizing social networks, (2) acknowledge the interdependencies in migrating towards {QS} {PKI}, (3) create an understanding of the technical standards in the field and their issuers, and (4) being highly realistic with both negative and positive scenarios to center the players’ understanding of real-world impact.},
