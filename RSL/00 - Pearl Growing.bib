	abstract = {Although quantum computing is still in its nascent age, its evolution threatens the most popular public-key encryption systems. Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman ({RSA}), elliptic curve cryptography ({ECC}) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security ({TLS}), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to {IoT} devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like {IoT} applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term {IoT} device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat. This article provides a survey on what can be called post-quantum {IoT} systems ({IoT} systems protected from the currently known quantum computing attacks): the main post-quantum cryptosystems and initiatives are reviewed, the most relevant {IoT} architectures and challenges are analyzed, and the expected future trends are indicated. Thus, this article is aimed at providing a wide view of post-quantum {IoT} security and give useful guidelines to the future post-quantum {IoT} developers.},

In this study, we discuss techniques able to provide security in a post-quantum {IoT}. Specifically, we examine how the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) {IoT} security solutions fair in a post-quantum environment. Also, we analyse the security features of fifth-generation (5G) networks, propose improvements and discuss the manner in which a quantum computer can compromise security. Our results prove the existence of multiple vulnerabilities in the current {IoT} architecture and implementations. With advances in quantum computing having rendered the current security algorithms unsafe, more advanced techniques should be established to mitigate such risks. To this end, we present promising lattice-driven cryptographic techniques which we prove quantum resistance.},

	abstract = {5th Generation(5G)-enabled Internet of Things ({IoT}) connects billions of devices for high -speed data transfer. The data collected fuel many automation applications such as smart cities, industrial automation 5.0, autonomous vehicles and healthcare sectors. However, the critical challenges concerning such an environment are Open Web Security and Mutual Authentication. The recent security protocols of {IoT} are based on hard mathematical cryptographic structures. Nevertheless, dependency on the security of classical cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by Quantum Computing. Recent Quantum attacks on {IoT} security have motivated us to survey Quantum-resistant solutions comprehensively. Therefore in this paper, we analysed how the technology shifts from classical cryptographic techniques towards quantum-enabled solutions to achieve end-to-end security. The main objective of this survey is to provide a systematic roadmap in the area of Quantum secured 5G-enabled {IoT} communication by covering current research on 5G-enabled {IoT} with its key enabling technologies, threats imposed on 5G-enabled {IoT} applications, state-of-the-art quantum-based solutions and initiatives. A detailed overview of the quantum computing preliminaries, Post Quantum Cryptography ({PQC}) schemes, Quantum Cryptography ({QC}), and Quantum Key Distribution ({QKD}) with their significant advantage in securing {IoT}-enabled communication over classical scenarios are also presented. Particularly, we emphasize Post-Quantum resistant techniques that must be used soon to secure 5G-enabled {IoT} communications. The comparative analysis of quantum-resistant schemes with classical cryptographic schemes in terms of key size, data size, time complexity and impact of quantum computers on these schemes are discussed. This paper identifies the technical challenges in Quantum-based schemes and provides future research directions to enable Post-Quantum resistant cryptography for secure communication in 5G-enabled {IoT}.},

	doi = {10.3390/s21051883},
	abstract = {Postquantum cryptography for elevating security against attacks by quantum computers in the Internet of Everything ({IoE}) is still in its infancy. Most postquantum based cryptosystems have longer keys and signature sizes and require more computations that span several orders of magnitude in energy consumption and computation time, hence the sizes of the keys and signature are considered as another aspect of security by green design. To address these issues, the security solutions should migrate to the advanced and potent methods for protection against quantum attacks and offer energy efficient and faster cryptocomputations. In this context, a novel security framework Lightweight Postquantum {ID}-based Signature ({LPQS}) for secure communication in the {IoE} environment is presented. The proposed {LPQS} framework incorporates a supersingular isogeny curve to present a digital signature with small key sizes which is quantum-resistant. To reduce the size of the keys, compressed curves are used and the validation of the signature depends on the commutative property of the curves. The unforgeability of {LPQS} under an adaptively chosen message attack is proved. Security analysis and the experimental validation of {LPQS} are performed under a realistic software simulation environment to assess its lightweight performance considering embedded nodes. It is evident that the size of keys and the signature of {LPQS} is smaller than that of existing signature-based postquantum security techniques for {IoE}. It is robust in the postquantum environment and efficient in terms of energy and computations.},

This threatens the security of any cryptographic system which often relies on the difficulty of factorisation. It also threatens methods based on discrete logarithms, such as with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method. For a cryptographic system to remain secure against a quantum adversary, we need to build methods based on a hard mathematical problem, which are not susceptible to Shor's algorithm and create Post Quantum Cryptography ({PQC}). While high-powered computing devices may be able to run these new methods, we need to investigate how well these methods run on limited powered devices. This paper outlines an evaluation framework for {PQC} within constrained devices, and contributes to the area by providing benchmarks of the front-running algorithms on a popular single-board low-power device. It also introduces a set of five notions which can be considered to determine the robustness of particular algorithms.},

	abstract = {Fog computing is an intermediate computing layer that has emerged to address the latency issues of cloud-based Internet of things ({IoT}) environments. As a result, new forms of security and privacy threats are emerging. These threats are mainly due to the huge number of sensors, as well as the enormous amount of data generated in {IoT} environments that needs to be processed in real time. These sensors send data to the cloud through the fog computing layer, creating an additional layer of vulnerabilities. In addition, the cloud by nature is vulnerable because cloud services can be located in different geographical locations and provided by multiple service providers. Moreover, cloud services can be hybrid and public, which exposes them to risks due to their infinite number of anonymous users. Access control ({AC}) is one of the essential prevention measures to protect data and services in computing environments. Many {AC} models have been implemented by researchers from academia and industry to address the problems associated with data breaches in pervasive computing environments. However, the question of which {AC} model(s) should be used to prevent unauthorized access to data remains. The selection of {AC} models for cloud-based {IoT} environments is highly dependent on the application requirements and how the {AC} models can impact the computation overhead. In this paper, we survey the features and challenges of {AC} models in the fog computing environment. We also discuss the diversity of different {AC} models. This survey provides the reader with state-of-the-art practices in the field of fog computing {AC} and helps to identify the existing gaps within the field.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, sustainable computing has been widely used in areas like social computing, artificial intelligence-based agent systems, mobile computing, and Internet of Things ({IoT}). There are social, economic, and commercial impacts of {IoT} on human lives. However, {IoT} nodes are generally power-constrained with data transmission using an open channel, i.e., Internet which opens the gates for various types of attacks on them. In this context, several efforts are initiated to deal with the evolving security issues in {IoT} systems and make them self-sufficient to harvest energy for smooth functioning. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we explore the evolving vulnerabilities in {IoT} devices. We provide a state-of-the-art survey that addresses multiple dimensions of the {IoT} realm. Moreover, we provide a general overview of {IoT}, Sustainable {IoT}, its architecture, and the Internet Engineering Task Force ({IETF}) protocol suite. Subsequently, we explore the open-source tools and datasets for the proliferation in research and growth of {IoT}. A detailed taxonomy of attacks associated with various vulnerabilities is also presented in the text. Then we have specifically focused on the {IoT} Vulnerability Assessment techniques followed by a case study on sustainability of Smart Agriculture. Finally, this paper outlines the emerging challenges related to {IoT} and its sustainability, and opening the doors for the beginners to start research in this promising area.},

With the rapid advancement of quantum computing technologies, it has become imperative to identify and standardize new cryptographic techniques that can withstand attacks from quantum computers. This paper explores the motivation behind {PQC} and provides an overview of the experimental research conducted in the field. It highlights the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptographic algorithms, such as {RSA} and {ECC}, to quantum attacks and emphasizes the need for transitioning to quantum-resistant alternatives. The experiments conducted in the {PQC} domain encompass the evaluation and analysis of candidate algorithms submitted to the {NIST} {PQC} competition. These experiments involve comprehensive security assessments, performance evaluations, and code audits to ensure the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in real-world scenarios. This paper provides guidelines for organizations and practitioners adopting {PQC}. It discusses considerations for selecting and implementing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, including security levels, algorithmic characteristics, performance tradeoffs, and integration challenges. It also outlines the importance of a smooth transition from classical to post-quantum cryptographic systems and highlights the need for standardization efforts to ensure interoperability and compatibility.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is emerging as a significant threat to information protected by widely used cryptographic systems. Cryptographic methods, once deemed secure for decades, are now at risk of being compromised, posing a massive threat to the security of sensitive data and communications across enterprises worldwide. As a result, there is an urgent need to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems. This is no simple task. Migrating to a quantum-safe state is a complex process, and many organisations lack the in-house expertise to navigate this transition without guidance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework designed to assist enterprises with this migration. Our framework outlines essential steps involved in the cryptographic migration process, and leverages existing organisational inventories. The framework facilitates the efficient identification of cryptographic assets and can be integrated with other enterprise frameworks smoothly. To underscore its practicality and effectiveness, we have incorporated case studies that utilise graph-theoretic techniques to pinpoint and assess cryptographic dependencies. This is useful in prioritising crypto-systems for replacement.},

	abstract = {Crypto agility refers to the ability of an entity to replace existing crypto primitives, algorithms, or protocols with a new alternative quickly, inexpensively, with no or acceptable risk exposure. These changes may be driven by regulatory action, advances in computing, or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Yet everyday operational needs may put crypto agility considerations on the back burner when deploying technology, designing processes, or developing products/services. Consequently, changes are often performed in an ad hoc manner. Transition from one crypto solution to another can then take a long time and expose organizations to unnecessary security risk. This paper presents a framework to analyze and evaluate the risk that results from the lack of crypto agility. The proposed framework can be used by organizations to determine an appropriate mitigation strategy commensurate with their risk tolerance. We demonstrate the application of this framework with a case study of quantum computing and related threats to cryptography in the context of {TLS} for Internet of Things.},

Quantum computers, along with quantum algorithms, make the standard cryptography based on {RSA} or {ECDSA} over {FL} or Blockchain vulnerable. The implementation of post-quantum cryptography ({PQC}) over such systems is poorly understood as {PQC} is still in its standardization phase. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to employ {PQC} over blockchain-based {FL} ({BFL}), where we combine a stateless signature scheme like Dilithium (or Falcon) with a stateful hash-based signature scheme like the extended Merkle Signature Scheme ({XMSS}). We propose a linear-based formulaic approach to device role selection mechanisms based on multiple factors to address the performance aspect. Our holistic approach of utilizing a verifiable random function ({VRF}) to assist in the blockchain consensus mechanism shows the practicality of the proposed approaches. The proposed method and extensive experimental results contribute to enhancing the security and performance aspects of {BFL} systems.},
